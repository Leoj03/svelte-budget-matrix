# Budget

Fork of forevermatt/svelte-budget, testing a [Matrix](matrix.org) based backend.

## Goals

- A budget app that can truly be productively used for free
- An affordable way for people to use features that inherently incur a cost
- A simple enough way to provide those cost-features that the income is worth
  the time/effort it takes to do so

## Data Structure

This application currently adheres to version 1.0.0 of the
https://github.com/forevermatt/budget-data specification.

## Development
